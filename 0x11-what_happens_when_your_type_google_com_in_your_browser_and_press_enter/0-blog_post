When you type "https://www.google.com" into your web browser's address bar and press Enter, several steps occur behind the scenes to load the Google website:

DNS Resolution: Your browser first needs to translate the human-readable domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address. It does this by sending a Domain Name System (DNS)
query to a DNS server, which returns the IP address associated with the domain.

Establishing a TCP Connection: Once your browser has the IP address, it establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to the web server that hosts Google's website.
This connection allows for reliable data transfer between your computer and the server.

SSL/TLS Handshake (if "https" is used): Since you specified "https" in the URL, a secure connection is established. Your browser and the web server negotiate encryption settings
using the SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) protocol. This ensures that the data transmitted between your browser and Google is encrypted and secure.

Sending an HTTP Request: Your browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the Google web server. This request contains information about the resource you are 
trying to access (in this case, the main Google webpage).

Web Server Processing: Google's web server receives the request and processes it. It identifies the resource you requested and may also use various algorithms and technologies
to deliver personalized content based on your location and previous interactions.

Generating a Webpage: Google's web server generates the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources needed to display the Google search page. This can include search results,
advertisements, and other elements.

Sending the Response: The web server sends the response, which includes the HTML and other resources, back to your browser over the established connection.

Rendering the Webpage: Your browser receives the response and starts rendering the webpage. It processes the HTML, applies styles with CSS, executes any JavaScript,
and displays the webpage on your screen.

Displaying the Webpage: Finally, you see the Google homepage in your browser, and you can interact with it, enter search queries, and use the various features provided by Google.

This entire process happens in a matter of seconds, and it allows you to access and interact with Google's search engine and other services over the internet.
